# Task "rt"
grit:lab Ã…land Islands 2023

## Build
```
./do
```

## Run
```
./we [camera file] [light file] [objects file]
```
One camera file, one light file and one objects file are required.  
The order of the files is important.  

## Example
```
./we use/camera1 use/light1 use/objects1
```

## Camera file example . The comments after `#` are ignored
```
# result image width in pixels, height in pixels, output file name without extension
# view angle in degrees. field of view of the camera
# from: x y z coordinates of the camera
# to: x y z coordinates of the point the camera is looking at. To build vector
# up: x y z coordinates of the end of up vector of the camera. To build vector

## Light file example . The comments after `#` are ignored
```
# power: a point light custom implementation of brightness control
# color: r g b color of the light source in range 0-255
# from: x y z coordinates of the light source
power 255

from 0 0 0
```

## Objects file example . The comments after `#` are ignored
```
# sphere: color, coordinates, radius
# cube: color, coordinates, size
# roll: color, coordinates, radius, height. it is like cylinder short name
# flat: color, coordinates, normal vector from zero point of the global coordinates
